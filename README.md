Toy **Visual Studio** app in *C++*.

UML diagrams, presentation and written report are also included.

The app is designed to operate offline, with users having to go to the physical machine in order to register or search for their prospective ever-loving mates. Profiles have some basic info such as gender, age, height, personalized tags and a personal public love message. Filters are available for searching through the database.

Database is plain text encrypted with a dumb algorithm, just a non-programmers-proof obstacle...
